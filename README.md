# HPC3
The assignment has been carried out on both Dardel and personal computers. Exercises 3 and 4 were done on a personal computer, while Exercises 1 and 2 were done on Dardel.

## Exercise 1 - MPI Hello World
1. The code can be found in exercise 1.
2. How do you compile it? Which compiler and flags have you used, if any?
To compile the MPI program on Dardel, I use cc MPI_Hello_World.c -o MPI_Hello_World because Cray's MPICH is loaded by default. On HPC, I use mpicc MPI_Hello_World.c -o MPI_Hello_World, with no additional flags needed.â€¨

3. How do you run the MPI code on Dardel?
To run the MPI code on Dardel, I use srun -n 4 ./MPI_Hello_World, where 4 processes will run.


## Exercise 2 - Measure Network Bandwidth and Latency on Dardel with Ping-Pong

## Exercise 3 - Why MPI_Send and MPI_Recv are called "blocking "communication?
It is because MPI_Send and MPI_Recv blocks the calling process until the data is safely copied out of the send buffer or fully received into the buffer.

## Exercise 4 - Calculate PI with MPI
